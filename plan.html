<h1>Welcome to my assessment</h1>
<p>_________________________________________</p>
<h1>Plan</h1>
<p>We already know about labels (OAH), we need a clinometer, Triginometry (Branch of Maths),
and how to solve the height of a tree. The observations we need are OAH, tangent ratios, clinometer,
Photo, drawing/angle tool, protractor (if photo printed on A4 paper) The topics we need to talk about are Triginometry, SOHCAHTOA, Angles 
We assume that Clinometers & calculators used correctly
The technology we use are a Clinometer, Camera & paint software, Calculator to get measurements &
calculate the height of the tree.</p>
<p> The list of steps that we need to get a solution are</p>
     <p>1.Measure using clinometer</p>
     <p>2.Take a photo and draw an angle with measurements</p>
     <p>3.Compare and use the more accurate result</p>
     <p>4.Calculate using tangent ratios</p>
