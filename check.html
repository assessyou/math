<p>My solution meets all aspects of the task because we used all of the
avaliable tools, and we did the appropriate steps according to SOH-CAH-TOA.</p>
<p>My solution meets all aspects of the task because we used all of the
avaliable tools, and we did the appropriate steps according to SOH-CAH-TOA.</p>
<p>My solution is reasonable because it is short, effective, and to the point.
Using a clinometer or taking a photo then measuring the angle in software if effective</p>
<p>The strengths and limitations of my solution is that sometimes, you can get
an inaccurate clinometer reading, and if you want to use a protractor, you have to
predict the correct size for the paper.</p>
<p>My solution could be improved by finding more methods (e.g. rope) and
to teach people how to do them (and use the software)</p>
